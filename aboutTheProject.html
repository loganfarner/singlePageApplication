    </main>
        <p>
            This website is a project that Will, Logan and Cesar are collaborating on for CISC 375 at the University of St. Thomas.
            This project combines an API we built earlier this semester along with Nomination and Leaflet API. The final product is an
            interactive crime map for St. Paul, Minnesota. The map allows you to see neighborhoods, their boundaries, search, filter, add 
            and delete. It uses the St. Paul crime database as the backend. Our API from the previous project manipulates said database; performing
            PUT, GET and DELETE requests to the database.
